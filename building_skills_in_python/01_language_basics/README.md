# Building Skills In Python - Language Basics

## Background and History

### History
- "a relatively simple programming language that includes a rich set of supporting libraries ... keeps the language simple and reliable, while providing specialized feature sets as separate extensions"
-  "is implemented in C, and relies on the extensive, well understood, portable C libraries"
-  "created in 1991"

### Features of Python 
- Object Oriented Language 
- dynamic not statically compiled language 
- "full access to OS services"
- shell scripting language

### Comparisons -- The Java Yardstick
- Simple and Familiar 
    - "  It relies on a few core data structures and statements "
- Object Oriented
    - single and multiple inheritence
- Secure
    - precompiled modules can be distributed to prevent alterations
    - builtin import function can be supplemented
    - no " buffer overflow " problem
    - dynamic: features like exec or eval can introduce problems, but are easy to identify
- Interperted
    - simpler edit-execute cycle vs compiled language's edit-compile-link-execute
    - interperter can be run interactively ??
    - interperter can, again, be extended with modules
- Dynamic
- Portable
    - rests on a portable C source
    - "OS inconsistency makes it imposible to provide perfect portability"
- Robust
    - "errors are raised as exceptions"
    - " mistakes lead to simple, easy-to-interpret error messages"
- Multithreaded
    - ((... it is definitely time to learn more about multithreaded stuff ))
- Garbage Collection
    - "The Python run-time environment handles garbage collection of all Python objects. Reference counters are used to assure that no live objects are removed. When objects go out of scope, they are eligible for garbage collection"
-  Exceptions
    - try statment to handle exceptions
    - exceptions raised in a uniform way
- High Performance 
    - "The Python interpreter is quite fast. However, where necessary, a class or module that is a bottleneck can be rewritten in C or C++, creating an extension to the runtime environment that improves performance."

## Getting Started
### Command Line Interaction
- Starting and Stopping CL Python
    - terminal instructions
    - type python to begin
    - type Control-D to end
- each statement is evaluated when entered
- a long statement can be broken into multiple lines using an escape character(\\)
